# EndangermentStatusChange

Includes two ipython notebooks that have how the data was collected and how the model was generated. For more information on this project check out my blog [post](https://liltong97.github.io/Project-McNulty/) about it. 

Also includes a Flask app containing a d3 visualization of the average change in endangerment status per country. To see it working, check out this [post](https://liltong97.github.io/d3-exploration/).
